                            The burning rivalry between Mac and PC is one of the most storied rivalries in the history of technology — ruining friendships, bringing down corporations, and inspiring some very creative commercials. After performing extensive research and experimentation with both types of computers, I’ve decided to side with Team Mac in this heated debate. I’m sure that many readers, particularly gamers, are rolling their eyes at me. But, please, before you all start jumping down my throat, hear me out.
       </p>
       <p>
                          Now, before I get into this, I need to establish some definitions here. In this article, I’m comparing Apple computers running Mac OS X to computers running the Windows operating system. I won’t be discussing computers running a LINUX distribution; I’ll save that for another blog post. I’m also not discussing Hackintoshes here. Hackintoshes are illegal; the Apple software license does not allow Mac OS X to be used on a computer that is not Apple-branded. Sure, now that Apple has switched over to Intel processors, they’re easy to make, but good luck if you get caught and have to face Apple’s sophisticated legal team before a jury.
       </p>

                         Historically, Microsoft has been a software company. These Surface tablets are the first hardware built by Microsoft in quite some time. Apple, on the other hand, controls the hardware and software in its computer business. This means that Apple can optimize and protect its computers in ways that Microsoft can’t. Apple’s operating system can therefore make presumptions about the hardware it will be functioning on because Apple can extensively test its operating system with every piece of hardware it releases. Microsoft doesn’t have this luxury, as dozens of manufacturers create hardware for Windows. This is where device drivers come into play, and why certain accessories or programs might be compatible from one Windows computer to another.
       </p>
       <p>
                        Macs are also less virus-prone than PCs. Apple devices are difficult to attack with viruses because of their numerous well-thought-out security features. Among them are Gatekeeper, which blocks any software that isn’t Apple-approved. If you try to open an app by a developer that Apple hasn’t verified, you will see the message “[This app] can’t be opened because it’s from an unidentified developer”. Mac OS X is also better protected because you cannot simply write to the system folders and files without a password. This makes it very difficult to create an effective virus for OS X and any other fully-POSIX compliant systems. Additionally, Apple hardware has no BIOS, so viruses that attack a BIOS can’t affect the Mac. This doesn’t mean that someone can’t design a virus for EFI, but it hasn’t happened yet, as far as I know. A majority of the world’s computers run Microsoft Windows, so most virus developers focus on PCs. Malware like Trojans, which entice users into downloading them by disguising themselves as desirable programs, like antivirus programs and botnets, which infect devices to circulate spam or promote fraud, are now prevalent occurrences among PCs, but rarely harm Macs. Sure, there’s a Trojan known as Mac Protector/Mac Guard/Mac Defender that’s been showing up on some Apple machines, but quite frankly, a Mac user who completely disregards their machine’s security is much less likely to be attacked by viruses than a PC user who invests in extensive security measures. A couple years back, Mac users had a security scare with a Flashback Trojan that exploited Java, using vulnerabilities in the Java Virtual Machine to gain access to the system. Apple eventually released an update to Java, but this served as a bit of a wake-up call, and ever since, the company has been quick to stop Java in its tracks as soon as any vulnerabilities in the Oracle software are identified. This means that from time to time, Apple will literally turn off Java, which means that web apps that use the tool will stop working while everyone waits for Oracle to fix it. Those are the lengths that Apple will go to to automatically keep their users safe.

                       Apple pays meticulous detail to the human interface, making the device intuitive to use and thereby reducing complexity. Apple’s attention to the human interface means that Macs are extremely easy to use. Apple has even made saving documents so foolproof that you don’t have to remember to save. Pages auto-saves your assignment frequently while you work. Additionally, you can move a program file/folder anywhere on a hard drive and it won’t crash. Macs will also update shortcuts (icons) that you had pointed to the program. There are many more aspects to OS X that make more complicated tasks far simpler on a Mac. On a Mac, deleting a program is a straightforward procedure. Uninstallers aren’t necessary — you can just delete the program from the applications folder. In contrast, deleting a program on a PC is never a simple task. You need to uninstall the program using Windows uninstaller and that doesn’t always remove all traces of a program. As a result, there are various apps that can uninstall programs for you. That’s just one example of the complications encountered by PC users. Many are trying to get a grip on Windows 8.1 right now. It takes some getting used to, especially since the start menu is no more and replaced by a start screen. This baffled me, and I wondered how to turn it off. This is basic stuff, and it’s just not obvious.

                             If you want to have a combination Mac and PC, a Mac is your best option. A Mac can run Microsoft Windows, but a PC cannot run Mac OS X. Upon booting Windows, there’s nothing a Mac computer can’t do.
       </p>
       <p>
                         The fact that Apple has a centralized identity is beneficial to many Mac users. It means you’ll get more efficient service. At a time when many PC users have their service centers shipped overseas, Mac users get live tech help at the Apple Store Genius Bar. If you have a problem with a Mac computer, whether it’s hardware or software, you can take it to the Genius Bar. But if you’re having issues with a PC, you might have to get two or more companies involved to resolve the issue.

                        Most Mac critics complain that Macs are too expensive. And I will definitely give them that. As a college student from a low-income family, there’s no way I could’ve afforded a MacBook Pro if I hadn’t won it in a scholarship program.
       </p>

                     Many of my gamer friends also insist that Macs are terrible for gaming. I’ll be honest - I’m not a gamer, so gaming isn’t a huge factor for me upon selecting computers. But I do believe that Macs are capable of producing nice graphics and making adequate gaming systems. Apple is the only OS and hardware that supports Colorsync, the industry standard for “what you see is what you get” color matching. Windows certainly doesn’t color-match as well as a Mac. Also, one of the many reasons that game developers are flocking to consoles is due to the unpredictability of the hardware on the PC. It becomes harder to design a game when you must support an endless variety of video cards and processors. Macs are easier to develop games for due to the fact that the hardware environment is better controlled, much like consoles. It’s not that OS X can’t run games, it’s that Windows has a bigger share and therefore, it makes more economic sense for the game developers to create games for the PC market.
       </p>
       <p>
                             Now, I may not do a lot of gaming, but I do do a lot of programming. And I can attest to the fact that a MacBook Pro gives you the widest coverage in terms of programming languages. It runs XCode and Unity 3D, which are both development applications. With Unity, you can export games for many platforms such as Windows, Mac, XBox, PlayStation, and iOS. This is something you can’t do on Windows because once you’ve exported on iOS, you’ll have to bring it into XCode, which doesn’t exist for Windows. OS X has the unique advantage that, above everything else, it lets you program applications for iPhones and iPads, which are quite a lucrative market. Of course, you can also program for Android devices on a Mac.

                          So, there are several advantages to owning a Mac over a PC such as superior security against viruses, human interfaces, and technical support. I have a 2010 version of a 13'’ MacBook Pro. I’ve owned it for five years, and I couldn’t be happier with it. I cannot imagine owning a PC ever again. To all everyone out there who wants to snub me for being a Mac lover, go right ahead.
