<h2 id=“childhoodandfamily”>A. Childhood and Family</h2>
<p>
I was born in New Rochelle, New York, about 15 minutes from The Bronx. And I grew up in San Diego, California, about 10 minutes from the U.S./Mexico border.
</p>
<p>
I am of Mexican descent and I was raised in the Mexican culture. My parents are from Mexicali, Baja California and Piedras Negras, Coahuila. They immigrated from Mexico to the U.S. as adults. Spanish is my native language.
</p>
<p>
I am the oldest of two daughters. My sister, who is five years younger, has special needs. She has autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Her functioning is severely impaired and she requires 24/7 care and supervision. I have devoted most of my life to taking care of her. Admittedly, we have more of a parent-child relationship than a sibling relationship, but regardless, we get along great. We enjoy exercising and watching movies together.
</p>
<p>
My childhood was very difficult and stressful due to issues related to poverty, domestic violence, addiction, suicide, . As a child, I took solace and comfort in activities such as reading, creative writing, and drawing. As I got older, I became more extroverted and was able to create a healthy support network of teachers, coaches, mentors, counselors, and peers. I got myself into therapy as a young adult, which is the smartest thing I've ever done because I've learned to cope effectively with trauma and negative emotions. Though, because I have a family history of suicide, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, I've devoted considerable time to mental health advocacy. I believe that mental health is just as if not more important than physical health, and it should be everyone's highest priority.
</p>
<h2><a id=“secondaryschool”>B. Secondary School Experience</a></h2>
<p>
From 2006 to 2010, I attended Bonita Vista High School in Chula Vista, California. During my time in high school, I was a very high achiever. I participated in science fairs and speech & debate, where I won several awards. During my junior year, I was the first in my district to advance to the California State Science Fair. Thanks to my high school, I had the opportunity to study French language and culture for four years. Over the years, I have continued practicing and learning French on my own. I now consider myself to have professional working proficiency in the French language. Upon graduating from BVHS, I earned an International Baccalaureate diploma, which is recognized by universities around the globe. 
</p>
<h1 id=“education”>II. Education</h1>
<h2 id=“ucsd”>A. University of California, San Diego</h2>
<p>
In my senior year of high school, I was admitted into several colleges and universities including but not limited to UCLA, Duke, and Pepperdine. I ultimately chose to attend the University of California, San Diego because it was the most economical choice. At UCSD, I majored in mathematics and computer science. I was involved in hackathons, programming competitions, and engineering societies. Also, by virtue of elective courses, I discovered a passion for history and literature. 
</p>
<h2 id=“globalbpm”>B. Global BPM DJ Academy</h2>
I attended the Global BPM DJ Academy to learn DJing and music mixing and mastering techniques. I was taught there by Antonio Aguilera (AKA DJ Yodah), who became my mentor. 
<h2 id=“citycollege”>C. San Diego City College</h2>
I later began taking music production classes at San Diego City College for fun. I ended up taking so many music classes there that I figured I might as well pursue an associate's degree in digital music technology. During my time at City College, I became an officer for the Music Club. I was put in charge of the Music Club's podcast and also became involved with the campus recording studio, MIDI Lab, and radio station. I graduated from San Diego City College in May 2021 with a 4.0 GPA in my major and a 3.9 overall. 
<h2 id=“nau”>D. Northern Arizona University</h2>
Immediately after graduating from San Diego City College, I transferred to Northern Arizona University. My education at NAU was 100% free because I received a generous grant from the school that covered all my expenses. I majored in liberal arts, so I took courses in literature, history, philosophy, political science, art, and sociology. My courses involved lots of reading and writing. I enjoyed them because I've always been an avid reader and fascinated by the humanities. If I didn't have to worry about making money, I'd spend a good portion of the day reading classic literature.
I am set to complete my bachelor's degree at Northern Arizona University on May 12, 2023. Because that date is quickly approaching, I am beginning to seek out full-time job opportunities. I am very excited to grow and apply my skills and experience toward my new role. I am currently based in San Diego, California, but I'm very interested in relocating outside of my hometown, so I'm only applying to jobs in cities I want to move to. 
<h1 id=“career”>III. CAREER</h1>
<h2 id=“audaexplore”>A. AudaExplore, a Solera Company</h2>
In 2015, I became a software engineering intern at AudaExplore, a Solera Company. I performed so well in the role that immediately after the internship ended, I was offered a position there as a software engineering contractor. I was the only intern among the summer 2015 batch that was asked to stay. During my time at AudaExplore, I worked on the mobile team, developing web and mobile apps for car insurance companies. I also had the pleasure of organizing a hackathon, performing quality assurance testing, and engaging in automation engineering. However, unfortunately, in 2016, the company decided to move its corporate headquarters to Utah and let go of all its San Diego employees. 
<h2 id=“milesius”>B. Milesius Capital Resources</h2>
Afterwards, I got a job as a software developer at a Chicago-based financial firm called Milesius Capital Resources. I had always been interested in finance, and during my time there, I became immersed in the world of trading. 
<h2 id=“softwareconsulting”>C. Independent Software Consulting</h2>
When my contract there ended, I decided to shift directions and go into business for myself. I launched my own software consulting business. I would get involved with professional societies and create online profiles to generate client leads. I soon found myself juggling several projects at a time. My clients ranged from early-stage startups, sole proprietors, and mid-stage startups. 
<h2 id=“pushauto”>D. PushAuto</h2>
Eventually, I co-founded my own tech startup in the automotive space with a corporate attorney I met at a tech meetup. As the company's chief technology officer, I was tasked with managing a team of developers at an NYC-based product engineering firm. Because many of the firm's engineers were based overseas, I found myself working at the crack of dawn to accommodate their schedules. Unfortunately, despite landing several investors, our startup ended up not working out. Still, I am grateful for the experience and feel that I was able to develop my management skills and grow as a leader.
<h2 id= “awesomeaudiovisual”>E. Awesome Audiovisual Productions</h2>
Ever since I was a teenager, I have been DJing as a hobby. I have had a lifelong passion for music and in my 20s, I enjoyed exploring the nightlife scene. I began picking up paid DJ gigs at local bars and nightclubs. Eventually, I was landing so many paid gigs that I realized I could turn this passion into a career. In 2017, I decided to launch my own DJ company. It evolved into a successful audiovisual productions company called Awesome Audiovisual Productions, which I'm still running to this day. I have held DJ residencies at bars, nightclubs, entertainment venues, sporting events, music festivals, retail stores, parades, and restaurants all over Southern California. I have had several high-profile clients including but not limited to California Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis, the California Democratic Party, and the U.S. Navy. 
<h2 id=“caregiving”>F. Caregiving</h2>
These days, aside from going to school full-time and running my business, I also work part-time as a caregiver for the disabled and the elderly. This partly involves taking care of my severely disabled younger sister who requires 24/7 care and supervision. 
<h2 id=“sdlff”>G. San Diego Latino Film Festival</h2>
Recently, I devoted a lot of time to handling social media, marketing, and PR for the San Diego Latino Film Festival. The San Diego Latino Film Festival is a large event that attracts many TV/radio stations, corporate sponsors, media personalities, film directors, actors, musicians, and artists. The festival was only 10 days long, but it was one of the most fun and meaningful experiences of my life because I got to meet so many interesting people.

C. Hobbies and Interests
Outside of school and work, I occupy my time with hobbies and interests including hiking, yoga, boxing, muay thai, drumming, playing the Bb clarinet, and watching Spanish-language telenovelas. I like listening to Latin trap, reggaeton, pop Latino, rock en espanol, hip-hop, 
D. Name Change
To clear up any confusion, I have legally changed my name to honor a mother figure/close friend who passed away after a painful battle with cancer. My birth name is also a common female Mexican name, so it isn't a drastic change. Though, it should be noted that because the name change is fairly recent, many still recognize me by my previous name. 
If there's anything else you'd like to know about me, feel free to ask. I'm an open book.
